Letâ€™s jump into all the methods for earning Gems in Brawl Stars!
There are several ways to earn free Gems in Brawl Stars. Although these methods may require some dedication, they offer reliable ways to gather this valuable currency over time. Here are the top strategies for earning Gems without spending real money:

1. Daily Logins & Quests

Simply logging into Brawl Stars daily can gradually increase your Gem count. Although the amounts might seem small, saving them up over time can be rewarding. Additionally, the game frequently offers daily challenges and quests that can yield Gems, so make sure to check in regularly and monitor the Supercell Store for new opportunities.

2. Events & Challenges

Participating in Special Events is another great way to boost your Gem earnings. You can find these events on the in-game calendar. Furthermore, the free version of the Brawl Pass provides plenty of opportunities to earn Gems through unique challenges, so be sure to take full advantage of both the free and premium Battle Pass tiers.
4. Tournaments

Although not guaranteed, tournaments are an excellent way to potentially earn Gems. Both official and community-run tournaments often provide Gems as rewards for participation and winning. To stay updated on available tournaments, join Brawl Stars communities on social media and forums.

5. Google Opinion Rewards

For a unique option, download the Google Opinion Rewards app. By completing surveys, you can earn Google Play credits, which can then be used to buy Gems in Brawl Stars without spending real money. Filling out surveys regularly can provide a nice addition to your Gem balance.

6. Hidden Gems in Boxes
7. Brawl Stars features three types of boxes: Brawl Boxes, Big Boxes, and Mega Boxes, with Mega Boxes offering the highest chance of dropping Gems. Although the odds of receiving Gems are low, consistently opening these boxes over time can yield a small but steady flow of Gems.

With these strategies, you can accumulate Gems gradually without making in-game purchases. Stick to these methods consistently, and youâ€™ll be able to unlock characters, skins, and other valuable items in Brawl Stars over time.

How to Buy Gems in Brawl Stars
If youâ€™re looking to buy Gems in Brawl Stars, the Paid Battle Pass offers more rewards than the free version, including additional Gems. Brawl Stars also frequently features limited-time offers, often with excellent discounts, which can provide significant value.

You can also purchase Gems directly through the Supercell Store at standard rates. Keep an eye out for special deals and bundles, as these often provide larger quantities of Gems for a reduced price. Take a moment to review all available offers to ensure youâ€™re getting the best deal before making a purchase.
Conclusion

There are several effective ways to gather Gems in Brawl Stars, whether through free methods or by purchasing them. Daily logins, quests, events, and achievements can steadily increase your Gem count without any cost, while the Paid Battle Pass and special offers provide additional options for faster rewards. By combining these strategies and staying consistent, you can unlock valuable content and progress efficiently. With a little patience and persistence, youâ€™ll have plenty of Gems to enhance your Brawl Stars experience.
